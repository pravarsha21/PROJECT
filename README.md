# PROJECT
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, our machine learning model must predicts whether the person is suffering from heart disease or not.The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the probability of heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the disease. In order to achieve the goal, we used data sets that was collected by Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Switzerland.The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, our machine learning model must predicts whether the person is suffering from heart disease or not.The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the probability of heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the disease.
