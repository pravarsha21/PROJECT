# PROJECT
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, our machine learning model must predicts whether the person is suffering from heart disease or not.The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the probability of heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the disease. In order to achieve the goal, we used data sets that was collected by Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Switzerland.The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, our machine learning model must predicts whether the person is suffering from heart disease or not.The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the probability of heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the disease.

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras'

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Accuracy achieved: 95% (KNN)
